# BirthDates

## How to install and run the project.

Clone the repo using the "git clone https://github.com/AnupSukumaran/BirthDates.git" command and after the download open the "BirthDates.xcodeproj" in the BirthDates folder.

## Reasoning behind the technical choices.

- For API calls, I selected GraphQL because it is convenient to use only one URL to parse the data and only get what you really want just by modifying the queries file.
- Apollo Framework helped to make the GraphQL API calls.
- Used SwiftLint to help maintain coding rules.


## What could have done more if I had more time.

- Impoved the UI a Bit more. 
- Added network connection checker
- Have added app icons.
